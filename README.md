# sparbuch

sparbuch is an eventstore.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install sparbuch
```

## Quick start

To use sparbuch first you need to add a reference to your application. You also need to specify which database to use:

```javascript
const sparbuch = require('sparbuch/postgres');
```

The following table lists all currently supported databases:

Database                | Package
------------------------|--------------------
PostgreSQL              | `sparbuch/postgres`
MongoDB  (experimental) | `sparbuch/mongodb`
In-memory               | `sparbuch/inmemory`

Once you have created a reference, you need to initialize the instance by running the `initialize` function. Hand over the connection string to your database as well as a namespace:

```javascript
await sparbuch.initialize({ url: '...', namespace: 'myApp' });
```

For the in-memory database there is no need to hand over the connection string and the namespace.

To handle getting disconnected from the database, subscribe to the `disconnect` event. Since sparbuch does not necessarily try to reconnect, it's probably best to restart your application:

```javascript
sparbuch.on('disconnect', () => {
  // ...
});
```

Since the in-memory database does not make use of an external system to store the data there is no need to subscribe to the `disconnect` event.

To manually disconnect from the database call the `destroy` function:

```javascript
await sparbuch.destroy();
```

By calling the `destroy` function, the in-memory data is resetted.

### Reading an event stream

To read the event stream for a given aggregate use the `getEventStream` function and provide the id of the aggregate. The function returns a regular Node.js readable stream:

```javascript
const aggregateId = 'd3152c91-190d-40e6-bf13-91dd76d5f374';

const eventStream = await sparbuch.getEventStream(aggregateId);
```

To limit the number of events returned you may use the `fromRevision` and `toRevision` options:

```javascript
const aggregateId = 'd3152c91-190d-40e6-bf13-91dd76d5f374';

const eventStream = await sparbuch.getEventStream(aggregateId, {
  fromRevision: 23,
  toRevision: 42
});
```

### Reading the last event

To read the last event for a given aggregate use the `getLastEvent` function and provide the id of the aggregate:

```javascript
const aggregateId = 'a6d18fc4-0ce3-4e3c-af43-fd451f58c0f1';

const event = await sparbuch.getLastEvent(aggregateId);
```

### Saving events

To save events use the `saveEvents` function and hand over an array of events you want to save. To create the events use the `Event` constructor function of the [commands-events](https://github.com/thenativeweb/commands-events) module:

```javascript
const eventStarted = new Event(...);
const eventJoined = new Event(...);

eventStarted.metadata.revision = 1;
eventJoined.metadata.revision = 2;

const savedEvents = await sparbuch.saveEvents({
  events: [ eventStarted, eventJoined ]
});
```

The assignment from the given events to their appropriate aggregates is done using the events' information. The `revision` of the events *must* be given in their `metadata` section.

*Please note that the events are saved within a single atomic transaction. If saving fails for at least one event, the entire transaction is rolled back, so no events are saved at all.*

#### Saving a single event

If you only want to save a single event you may omit the brackets of the array and directly specify the event as parameter:

```javascript
const eventStarted = new Event(...);

eventStarted.metadata.revision = 1;

const savedEvents = await sparbuch.saveEvents({ events: eventStarted });
```

#### Respecting the event stream order

Every event is automatically assigned a position within the entire event stream. This way you can figure out the insertion order at a later point in time, e.g. when replaying. This value is a `number` and stored using the property `event.metadata.position`.

The position is available when fetching the event stream using the `getEventStream` function, or after having called `saveEvents` on the saved events that are returned.

*Please note that the event store guarantees that the positions are monotonically increasing, but they may have gaps, i.e. some positions may be missing. This may happen, e.g. when saving events failed and had to be retried.*

### Reading unpublished events

To read all unpublished events as a stream, call the `getUnpublishedEventStream` function. The function returns a regular Node.js readable stream:

```javascript
const eventStream = await sparbuch.getUnpublishedEventStream();
```

### Marking events as published

Once you have published events using an event publisher you may mark them as published using the `markEventsAsPublished` function. Hand over the aggregate id as well as the revision from which to which you would like to mark the events as published:

```javascript
const aggregateId = 'd3152c91-190d-40e6-bf13-91dd76d5f374';

await sparbuch.markEventsAsPublished({
  aggregateId,
  fromRevision: 23,
  toRevision: 42
});
```

### Reading a snapshot

To read the event stream for a given aggregate use the `getSnapshot` function and provide the id of the aggregate. The function always returns the `revision` and `state` of the newest snapshot. If no snapshot exists, the function returns `undefined`:

```javascript
const aggregateId = 'd3152c91-190d-40e6-bf13-91dd76d5f374';

const snapshot = await sparbuch.getSnapshot(aggregateId);
```

### Saving a snapshot

To save a snapshot for an aggregate use the `saveSnapshot` function and hand over the aggregate id, the revision and the state of the aggregate:

```javascript
const aggregateId = 'd3152c91-190d-40e6-bf13-91dd76d5f374';
const revision = 23;
const state = {
  // ...
};

await sparbuch.saveSnapshot({ aggregateId, revision, state });
```

*Please note that if a snapshot was already saved for the given aggregate id and revision, this function does nothing.*

### Getting a replay

To get a replay of events use the `getReplay` function. The function returns a regular Node.js readable stream:

```javascript
const replayStream = await sparbuch.getReplay();
```

To limit the number of events returned you may use the `fromPosition` and `toPosition` options:

```javascript
const replayStream = await sparbuch.getReplay({
  fromPosition: 7,
  toPosition: 23
});
```

## Running the build
